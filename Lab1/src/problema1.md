## Introduction

Python is an interpreted, high-level, and easy-to-read programming language, used both for application development and for data analysis. Its straightforward syntax allows beginners to quickly grasp the fundamentals, and it has a large community that contributes libraries and solutions for a wide range of needs.

### Variable types

Variable types in Python:

    •int: Represents integer numbers (e.g., 5, -3).
    •float: Stores decimal or floating-point numbers (e.g., 3.14, -2.7).
    •str (string): Contains text strings (e.g., "Hello world").
    •bool (boolean): Can only take the values True or False.
    •list: An ordered, mutable collection of elements (e.g., [1, 2, 3]).
    •dict (dictionary): A key-value mapping structure (e.g., {"name": "Ana", "age": 25}).

### Control structures

In Python, there are several control structures that allow you to direct the flow of a program’s execution. One of them is the **while** loop, which repeats as long as the specified condition remains true and stops when it no longer holds. The **for** loop, on the other hand, iterates over each element of a sequence (such as a list or tuple), executing the same block of code for each element. For decision-making, the **if** conditional structure is used, complemented by **else if** and **else**, which evaluate sequential conditions and execute the corresponding block of code depending on whether they are true or false. Finally, there are keywords like **break**, which completely interrupts a loop; **continue**, which skips to the next iteration; and **pass**, which acts as a placeholder without performing any concrete action.


# Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python

**Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** in Python organizes code around entities called **classes**, which act as templates for creating objects with attributes and methods. This approach allows for a clear and modular structure by grouping related data and behaviors in one place.

Its main components are classes, objects, attributes, and methods. A class is defined using the reserved word `class`, and when it is instantiated, it generates objects with their own characteristics and behaviors. Additionally, OOP utilizes concepts such as **encapsulation**, which protects data, and **inheritance**, which facilitates code reuse and extension by sharing properties among classes.

To use OOP in Python, you first define the class (for example, `Persona`) with an `__init__` constructor method that initializes the attributes, along with methods that describe its actions. Then, you create objects from the class, each with its own set of attribute values but sharing the same functions and behaviors.
