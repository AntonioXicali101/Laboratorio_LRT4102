## Introduction

Python is an interpreted, high-level, and easy-to-read programming language, used both for application development and for data analysis. Its straightforward syntax allows beginners to quickly grasp the fundamentals, and it has a large community that contributes libraries and solutions for a wide range of needs.

### Variable types

Variable types in Python:

    •int: Represents integer numbers (e.g., 5, -3).
    •float: Stores decimal or floating-point numbers (e.g., 3.14, -2.7).
    •str (string): Contains text strings (e.g., "Hello world").
    •bool (boolean): Can only take the values True or False.
    •list: An ordered, mutable collection of elements (e.g., [1, 2, 3]).
    •dict (dictionary): A key-value mapping structure (e.g., {"name": "Ana", "age": 25}).

### Control structures

In Python, there are several control structures that allow you to direct the flow of a program’s execution. One of them is the **while** loop, which repeats as long as the specified condition remains true and stops when it no longer holds. The **for** loop, on the other hand, iterates over each element of a sequence (such as a list or tuple), executing the same block of code for each element. For decision-making, the **if** conditional structure is used, complemented by **else if** and **else**, which evaluate sequential conditions and execute the corresponding block of code depending on whether they are true or false. Finally, there are keywords like **break**, which completely interrupts a loop; **continue**, which skips to the next iteration; and **pass**, which acts as a placeholder without performing any concrete action.
