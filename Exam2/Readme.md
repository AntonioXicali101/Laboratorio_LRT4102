\section*{Robot Performance Evaluation Report}

\subsection*{Introduction}

This report presents a comprehensive evaluation of the performance of an autonomous robot designed to detect and collect red and green-colored debris, which constitute the primary targets of the system. The evaluation focuses on quantifying the robot’s accuracy and efficiency in fulfilling its operational objectives through a set of well-defined metrics under controlled and simulated conditions.

\subsection*{Methodology}

To assess the robot’s effectiveness, several key performance indicators were established:

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Detection Precision:} The ratio of correctly identified objects to the total number of detection events.
  \item \textbf{Recall (Sensitivity):} The capability of the robot to detect the maximum possible number of actual debris present within the operational environment.
  \item \textbf{Effective Collection Rate:} The percentage of detected objects that the robot successfully collects.
\end{itemize}

Experiments were conducted in a controlled setting, where a predetermined number of debris items were strategically placed at fixed and varying locations. Throughout autonomous detection and collection missions, all detection events, collection attempts, and outcomes were systematically recorded. Timestamp data was also logged to calculate the average time taken per detection and collection, providing insight into the robot’s operational speed and efficiency.

\subsection*{Results and Analysis}

The gathered data was thoroughly analyzed to benchmark the robot’s actual performance against the initial design specifications. This analysis identified several types of errors, including false positives, missed detections, and unsuccessful collection attempts. Patterns influencing performance variability under different environmental and system configuration conditions were also examined.

Further assessment focused on the robot’s consistency across diverse scenarios, alongside the adaptability of its modular Robot Operating System (ROS)-based architecture to handle unexpected challenges such as obstacles or lighting changes that may adversely affect visual detection.

\subsection*{Improvement Recommendations}

As part of an iterative development process, recommendations were formulated to enhance system performance. Key proposals include refining the image processing algorithms to improve color discrimination capabilities and reduce false detection rates. Additionally, adjustments to the actuator design aim to increase the reliability and speed of the collection mechanism.

Implementing these improvements is expected to maximize the robot’s effectiveness in real-world environmental applications, particularly in water body cleanup tasks, thereby contributing positively to sustainability efforts.

\subsection*{Conclusion}

The evaluation employing quantitative metrics enabled an objective measurement of the robot’s precision, recall, and collection efficiency. Findings highlight opportunities for optimization that will reinforce the robot’s capacity to operate reliably in dynamic environments. This positions the system as a promising tool for environmental remediation and sustainable technology solutions.
