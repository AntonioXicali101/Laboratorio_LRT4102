## Introduction

This report focuses on evaluating the detection precision of an autonomous robot designed to identify red and green-colored debris. Detection precision is a critical metric that measures the ratio of correctly identified debris relative to all detection events, reflecting the accuracy and reliability of the robot’s computer vision system in distinguishing target objects from background and noise.

The ability to accurately detect debris is essential for efficient operation, as false detections can lead to wasted resources and reduced overall performance. Thus, quantifying precision helps to understand how well the robot's vision algorithms perform in real-world-like scenarios.

## Detection Precision Metric

Detection precision is formally defined as:

$$
\text{Precision} = \frac{\text{True Positives}}{\text{True Positives} + \text{False Positives}}
$$

where:

- **True Positives (TP):** The number of debris objects correctly identified by the robot’s vision system.
- **False Positives (FP):** Instances where the system incorrectly classifies non-target objects, background elements, or noise as debris.

High precision indicates that the robot’s detection system rarely misclassifies irrelevant or misleading features as debris, which is crucial to avoid unnecessary activation of the collection mechanism and to conserve energy and time during operation.

## Experimental Setup

The evaluation was conducted in a controlled environment designed to simulate operational conditions. A known quantity of red and green debris items were carefully placed at fixed and variable locations throughout the testing area to represent common spatial distributions.

During each test run, the robot autonomously scanned the environment using its onboard camera and vision algorithms. Every detection event was logged with timestamps and tagged as true positive or false positive based on ground truth validation.

Multiple tests were performed under varying environmental factors such as lighting conditions, background complexity, and presence of reflective surfaces. This allowed for a thorough assessment of the detection precision metric’s stability and sensitivity across diverse scenarios.

## Results and Analysis

The data analysis showed that the robot maintains high detection precision in well-controlled lighting and simple backgrounds, with true positives comprising the vast majority of detections. This indicates that the vision system effectively differentiates between target debris colors and other elements.

However, in scenarios with lower lighting quality or visually cluttered backgrounds, precision slightly decreased due to an increase in false positives. Common sources of false detection included shadows, reflections on surfaces, and objects with colors similar to the target debris.

Despite these challenges, the overall precision remained at a level considered acceptable for practical applications, demonstrating the robustness of the current detection algorithms. The analysis also highlighted specific conditions under which false positives tend to cluster, providing valuable insight for targeted algorithmic improvements.

## Recommendations for Improvement

To further enhance detection precision, the following strategies are recommended:

- **Algorithm Optimization:** Fine-tuning color filtering thresholds and employing more sophisticated color space transformations to better distinguish subtle color differences.
- **Adaptive Techniques:** Implementing adaptive thresholding that dynamically adjusts to ambient lighting conditions to reduce sensitivity to environmental changes.
- **Noise Reduction:** Applying advanced filtering and morphological operations to preprocess images, minimizing noise and spurious detections caused by reflections or background clutter.
- **Machine Learning Approaches:** Integrating machine learning classifiers trained on diverse datasets to improve classification accuracy beyond traditional color-based methods.

By adopting these enhancements, the robot’s vision system can achieve higher precision, leading to fewer false alarms and more reliable operational performance.

## Conclusion

Detection precision is a foundational metric for evaluating the quality and reliability of the robot’s vision-based debris detection capabilities. The current evaluation confirms that the system performs well in controlled conditions, with a clear understanding of the environmental factors that impact accuracy.

Addressing the identified limitations through recommended improvements will contribute to increasing precision further, enabling more efficient debris collection with less wasted effort. Ultimately, optimizing detection precision enhances the robot’s overall effectiveness and supports its role in environmental cleanup applications.
