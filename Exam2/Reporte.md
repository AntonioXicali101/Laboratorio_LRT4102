## Introduction

This report presents a comprehensive evaluation of the detection precision of an autonomous robot designed to identify red and green-colored debris within a simulated environment. Detection precision is a critical performance metric that quantifies the accuracy of the robot’s vision system by measuring the proportion of correctly identified debris relative to all detection events. This metric directly reflects the reliability and robustness of the object detection algorithms in distinguishing true debris items from background noise and false signals.

The capability to accurately detect debris is fundamental to the robot’s operational efficiency. False detections not only waste valuable energy and time but can also trigger unnecessary activation of collection mechanisms, which may lead to mechanical wear or operational delays. Therefore, precise quantification of detection precision is essential for assessing and improving the overall functionality and deployment readiness of such autonomous systems, especially when applied to real-world environmental cleanup tasks.

## Detection Precision Metric

Detection precision is mathematically defined as follows:

$$
\text{Precision} = \frac{\text{True Positives}}{\text{True Positives} + \text{False Positives}}
$$

where:

- **True Positives (TP):** The count of debris objects correctly identified by the vision system.
- **False Positives (FP):** The count of incorrect detections where the system mistakenly classifies background elements, noise, or non-target objects as debris.

A high precision value indicates that the detection system minimizes the misclassification of irrelevant elements as debris, which is essential to maintain operational efficiency and resource conservation.

## Experimental Setup

The evaluation was carried out in a controlled environment replicating common operational conditions. Ten pieces of simulated debris, colored red and green, were placed strategically at both fixed and varying positions within the operational field of the robot. This setup aimed to emulate realistic spatial distributions encountered in field operations.

The robot autonomously navigated the environment using an onboard camera coupled with computer vision algorithms that perform real-time detection. Each detection event was timestamped and cross-referenced against the ground truth positions to categorize outcomes as true or false positives.

Tests were repeated across different environmental conditions, including variations in ambient lighting, background complexity, and the presence of reflective surfaces. Such variations allowed for the assessment of the detection system’s robustness and stability in the face of environmental perturbations.

## Results and Analysis

Analysis of collected data demonstrated that the robot’s vision system achieved high detection precision under controlled lighting and simple background conditions, with true positives constituting the majority of detections. This outcome suggests effective differentiation of target debris colors from the environment.

Nevertheless, a slight decrease in precision was observed in scenarios with reduced lighting quality and visually complex backgrounds. This reduction was mainly attributed to an increase in false positives caused by environmental artifacts such as shadows, surface reflections, and objects bearing similar hues to the target debris.

Despite these challenges, the overall precision remained above 80%, a threshold considered acceptable for practical deployment in robotic cleanup applications. The results also identified specific conditions where false positives are more prevalent, offering insights into potential targets for algorithm refinement.

## Recommendations for Improvement

To further improve detection precision, the following strategies are recommended:

- **Algorithmic Refinement:** Adjust color segmentation thresholds and explore advanced color space transformations to enhance differentiation of debris colors under varying conditions.
- **Adaptive Thresholding:** Develop dynamic thresholding mechanisms that adapt to real-time lighting changes, reducing sensitivity to environmental fluctuations.
- **Preprocessing Enhancements:** Employ noise reduction filters and morphological operations to clean input images, decreasing the likelihood of spurious detections from reflections or clutter.
- **Machine Learning Integration:** Incorporate supervised learning techniques, such as convolutional neural networks trained on diversified datasets, to move beyond simple color-based detection and increase classification robustness.

Implementation of these recommendations can lead to a more reliable detection system with higher precision, ultimately improving the robot’s operational effectiveness.

## Conclusion

Detection precision stands as a key performance indicator in assessing the accuracy and reliability of the robot’s vision system for debris detection. The current evaluation reveals that the system performs adequately under controlled scenarios, with a clear understanding of environmental factors influencing detection outcomes.

Addressing identified limitations through targeted improvements promises to enhance detection precision, thereby optimizing debris collection efficiency and reducing wasted effort. These advancements are crucial for deploying autonomous robots in real-world environmental remediation tasks, where precision and reliability are paramount.
